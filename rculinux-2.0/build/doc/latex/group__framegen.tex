The Framegenerator framegen can be used to read out frames from the Xilinx which will be stored with read and write headers and footers.  
All the frames that should be read out have to be given in a ascii text file in the first parameter. One Frame per line in this format: \char`\"{}0;5;3;\char`\"{}. Comments are allowed with leading \char`\"{}\#\char`\"{}.

The second parameter to be given is the readheader file, every line contains a value to be written to the Xilinx, the address has to be inserted as variables \char`\"{}\$frame\_\-addr31\_\-16\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}\$frame\_\-addr15\_\-0\char`\"{}. These addresses will be generated from the framesfile.

third parameter is the readfooter, 4th the writeheader and 5th the writefooter.

For every frame, 3 Files will be generated: w\_\-frame\-X.X.X.hex, r\_\-frame.X.X.X.hex and frame\-X.X.X.hex where one contains the readheader with the address instead of the variable, then the data and the read\_\-footer, the other containing the writeheader, 2 times the data and the writefooter and the 3rd one containing just the data.

All generated files will be stored in the working directory.
