17.03.2007 version 1.5
 - HIB student project on selectmap driver added to project
 - no changes in rcu-sh
 - RCU flash access tools added

15.02.2006 version 1.4.2 minor corrections
   - time out constant for flash erase (multi-)sector increased
   - changed the 'echo' command to print out on stdout instead of stderr 

15.02.2006 version 1.4
 - firmware version 2.2 supported:
   - compressed data formats for multi write

   - memory guard
   - bugfix in msg buffer interface (buffer allocation)

16.11.2005 version 1.3
 - flash command group added: read, write, verify, erase, reset, id
 - the flash uses file specifier -b2 by default (16 bit binary) for write and verify
 - !!! Note: there is currently no protection and handling of concurrent processes for the 
   flash functionality implemented !!!
 - all error messages from the dcsc message buffer interface are redirected to stderr
 - binary format options for read command output
 - byte swap for write commands and flash verify
	
03.11.2005 corrections for version 1.2
 - dcscMsgBufferInterface: comstat bits corrected
 - dcscMsgBufferInterface: flash/selectmap disable requires correct state
	
01.11.2005 release of version 1.2
 - new commands: flash, selectmap group to set the bus mode
 - dcscMsgBufferInterface: modes msgbuffer, flash and selectmap added; state check 
 - dcscMsgBufferInterface: bus control function added to API

24.05.2005 (pre)release of version 1.1, some minor changes done on 25.05.2005
 - command line options
   -v, --verbosity
   -d, --device=
   -e, --encode
   -a, --append
   --mibsize
   --debug (added 25.05.)
 - started using verbosity in dcscRCUaccess 
 - bugfix for command line mode
 - bugfix concerning formatting of read output
 - driver lock implemented and driver control tools added

11.05.2005
 - command encoding
 - new command 'checkmsgblock <file> -v <verbosity>
 - bad hack cmdInterpreter: execWriteCommand used to call the dcscCheckMessageBlock function 

09.05.2005 still version 1.0
 - msg block check function added to dcscRCUaccess, not yet used
 
02.05.2005 starting version 1.0
 - merged branch v0-7-patches into main branch
 - same features as version 0.8, but optimized buffer encoding

===============================================================
24.04.2004 version 0.1
 changes in rcu access library
 - fetches driver buffer sizes and adopts operations to this
 - preliminary implementation of multiple write/read
 - change file access to basic file io (open/close/read/write/ioctl)
 changes in sendAltroCommand
 - new option to read driver info
 
26.04.2004 version 0.2
 changes in rcu access library
 - translation of result buffer and human readable error messages
 - better performance due to changed read of result buffer, skip additioanal data copy
 - multiple read/write fully suported now, the operation is splitted into sub operations if
   the size of the message buffers is smaller than the data block
 - data blocks of different word sizes can be passed to multiple write
 changes in sendAltroCommand
 - new debug option for printing info data block splitting : 0x40 
 - better performance for multiple write, additional data copying for non 32bit data skipped

version 0.6
 - shell mode
 - command line history and editing

22.10.2004: version 0.7
 - bugfix in cmdInterpreter.c, executeCommandArgs: seg fault for '-' command
 - a check for accidental use of '-', e.g. '-b' instead of 'b' warns the user
 - enhanced documentation in the header files 

22.04.2005: version 0.8

   - output format
   - output redirection
 - batch processing
   - loop count as argument
   - infinite loops supported, terminated by CTRL-C (SIGINT)
   - verbosity level as argument
 - 'c' command introduced substituted with w <address> 0x0
